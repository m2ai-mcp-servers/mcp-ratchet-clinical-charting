| Test credentials | NOT ACQUIRED | |
| Test patient data | NOT ACQUIRED | |
| Rate limits (sandbox) | Unknown | |

### 5. Sample Data

For developing and testing, we need:

- [ ] Sample patient search response (JSON)
- [ ] Sample visit note creation request/response
- [ ] Sample patient history response
- [ ] Error response examples
- [ ] Rate limit error examples

### 6. Technical Details

| Detail | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Base API URL | Unknown | |
| API version | Unknown | |

## How to Acquire

### Option 1: Direct Request to PointCare
Contact PointCare directly for developer/API access:
- Website: https://www.pointcare.com
- Look for "Developers", "API", or "Integration Partners" section

### Option 2: Through Employer
If Stacey's company already uses PointCare:
- Check if they have API documentation
- Ask IT department about integration capabilities
- Request developer access through company account

### Option 3: Partner Program
Some EMR systems have partner programs:
- Check for PointCare partner/integration program
- May require application and approval process

## Impact on Development

Without API documentation:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Tool parameter definitions | Skeleton only |
| Response type definitions | Blocked |
| Integration tests | Blocked |
| Error handling | Generic only |
| PRD completion | Blocked |
| Grimlock sprint | Cannot start |

## Next Steps

1. **Identify contact path** - Determine best way to request API access
2. **Submit request** - Contact PointCare for API documentation
3. **Obtain sandbox access** - Request test environment credentials
4. **Update PRD** - Complete tool specifications with real API details
5. **Resume development** - Unblock Grimlock sprint

## Notes

- HIPAA considerations may affect API access approval process
- May need to sign Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- Company may already have API access we don't know about
- Some EMR systems require partnership agreements for API access
